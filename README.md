kjell.os
=======

A lightweight terminal based Linux OS designed for Smart Phones and other smart devices. Pronounced "shell-o-s"

See Wiki for more Information.

## Why?

Why add yet another phone OS? Because all the current ones suck. I like that my smart phone is "smart" and can run lots off useless apps and allow me to play lots of stupid games and, of course, have lots of meaningless interactions with lots of random people. 

## What is it?

Kjell.OS is simplicity at it's best. Primary goals of this project are as follow :
* Power Consumption - 2 Week battery life with normal use
* Untethered - VoIP ONLY. Carriers need only be necessary for data...if you need that. No contracts, hidden fees. Use phone when, where, and however you want.
* Secure - VPNs configuration suggested by default. Open source marketplace requiring testers.
* Fast -  Console based UI targeted at more advanced users. 
* Simple - Straight forward processes to perform necessary functions including but not limited too..

## Features : 

* VoIP calls
* Photos/Videos
* Information Gathering via jasper-like text-based AI
* Texting
* Chatting via third party services (ie Facebook -blah)
* Running stable, community tested, CLI based applications, accessibly **ONLY **via secure opensource marketplace. _(Application can't be published until they are thoroughly tested by volunteer beta testers)_
